                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect basic information about your device, such as the operating system, device model, and unique device identifiers.</li>
                <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> If the App crashes, we may collect diagnostic information to help us fix the problem.</li>

        <li>Ensure the security of our Service and prevent fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>

This includes cloud hosting providers (e.g., Google Firebase), analytics providers, and AI service providers (e.g., OpenAI).</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal process.</li>
